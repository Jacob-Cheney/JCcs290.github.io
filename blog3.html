               I would consider this assignment to be difficult for me personally because it's the first time I had worked with javascript in a long while, consequentally alot of the 
                interactions between the css and javascript that was required took me a  bit of time to fully understand.

               I wouldn't say that I learned a  lot of javascript neccesarily, but I did learn a lot of how javascript interacts with css and that sort  of application. I think that 
               javascript is going to have a lot of presence in my life if I continue to do web development because the functionality it adds to to css is very useful, personally, I think
               linking up a full stack with  javascript and a database is going to be a fun challenge for me.

                Once again, I used the slides and lectures as a way to get an understanding of javascript, but I went to my  friends to ask for help, especially the live search function. 
                this brought me back to previous classes where  there was heavy emphasis on specific algorithms to use in order to accomplish a goal.
