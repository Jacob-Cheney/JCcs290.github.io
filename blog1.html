                <br>This is my very first blog post!
                <br></br>
                <br> The setup for this assignment took some time since I hadn't worked with
                Github or html/css in sometime. Figuring out how to push and clone things was confusing at first but I managed.
                <br></br>
                <br>This assignment taught me a lot about organization for webpages where as before I would have a single page 
                that would be quite disorganized with a lot of "test features". I already had experience with some html and css, with mild JS as well, but again, lacked an interest
                in general organization.
                <br></br>
                <br>Reading over the lectures for html/css was very helpful in getting my feet on the ground in order to build the pages for this assignment. Also, the website www.w3schools.com
                is something I use quite often when looking for resources and help for most things related to web development and used some of their guides on 
                <a href =https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp>Navigation Bars</a>
                In order to build my page and organization.
