                This assignment wasn't too difficult, but did give me some trouble in the way of details. Most of the specific requirments were things
                I  had to experiment with a lot before it worked in the way I intended it  to. I solved those problems by googling the elements I observed in the mocks,
                which ended up enhancing my learning even more because the solutions were varied.

                I learned a whole lot about flex, flexboxses, and all the intracacies that exist within this way of defining sections in css. Overall,
                It's obviously a much better way of organizing information compared to the potential other solutions that exist. The way flexboses work 
                isn't neccesarily easier to understand than just using divs and other methods, but it's much easier to create adaptable and reusable frameworks 
                for websites.

                I used the slides as a basis to understand how certain parts of css operated, but mostly used google to figure out how certain aspects of 
                the website should be built. In the end, I didn't get all the parts working correctly, but did make it look and act very similar to the mocks given.
